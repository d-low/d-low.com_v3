d-low.com 
---
 
This is the fourth iteration of my personal website d-low.com which chronicles
adventurous and less adventurous things I've done in my life. The fourth 
iteration was built to showcase my skills as a front end web developer and learn
new, modern, front end technologies. It is built with a mobile first approach, 
written in ES6, using the React library, making use of CSS modules, and using 
Webpack as the module bundler and build tool.

You may be wondering why this repository is titled `d-low.com_v3` when it is
the _fourth_ iteration of my personal website. The original version, written in
PHP in 2005, used Subversion for source control. So when newer versions were 
written, first in Ruby on Rails - which proved to be too slow, and then using
Backbone.js as a single page web app, they were hosted in repositories named
[d-low.com](https://github.com/d-low/d-low.com) and 
[d-low.com_v2](https://github.com/d-low/d-low.com_v2), respectively. So this
fourth iteration is hosted in the _v3_ repository in GitHub.

To Do

- **Required for Launch**:
  - [x] Use scrollable site header with right fade instead of a [hamburger](https://uxplanet.org/great-alternatives-to-hamburger-menus-d4c76d9414dd) in mobile view
    - [ ] Fix sticky hover on mobile after clicking on link
      - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2741816/is-it-possible-to-force-ignore-the-hover-pseudoclass-for-iphone-ipad-users/27680370#40617793

    - [ ] More elegant side fade out styles, or remove when link hover/active
  - [x] Handle old "#content/" routes to remap Backbone routes, _perhaps in Apache config_?
   - Use a solution similar to how `$rootScope.$on('$locationChangeStart', ...)` is handled
     in [`mobile UI`](http://d20h79ce57am7k.cloudfront.net/fed06fe9da4f890fd3cc20be7fc4059ef472eabc/scripts/app.js)?
   - Use the [`onEnter()`](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/blob/v3/docs/API.md#onenternextstate-replace-callback) event to redirect from `#content/05-Colorado/12-Colorado-2017/02-Spring/01-Spring_Break_In_New_Mexico-Mar_25_2017` to `/05-Colorado/12-Colorado-2017/02-Spring/01-Spring_Break_In_New_Mexico-Mar_25_2017`.
  - [ ] Use minimal .htaccess to enable CORS etc.
    - See: https://gist.github.com/davemackintosh/8ac35fff747dbf2c95e1
  - [ ] Sort images by file name in `generate_content.rb`

    - [ ] Load data (/data/content.js) asynchrounously on page load and once loaded 
        run the app.

    - [ ] Previously loaded images aren't displayed immediately
  - React Router
    - [ ] Use mobile page transitions (Ã  la Clip Artist App)?
    - [ ] Can we reduce the number of re-rendered components when navigating from home page?
  - Code Review
    - [ ] Use consistent coding style for presentation components definition
